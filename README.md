This is a Number Guessing Game Using Java Language

This is a Java code for a number guessing game where the player has to guess a random number between 1 and 100. 
The game is played in three rounds, and the player has five attempts to guess the correct number in each round.
The score is calculated based on the number of attempts remaining when the player guesses the number correctly. 
The total score across all rounds is displayed at the end of each round, and the final score is displayed at the end of the game. 
The code uses loops, random number generation, and conditional statements to implement the game logic.
